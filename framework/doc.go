// Package framework contains a high-level framework for writing Waypoint
// plugins. The framework is split into sub-packages for specific functionality,
// whereas this root package contains the highest-level functionality.
//
// Note: the root package is still a work-in-progress. For now, please use the
// sub-packages. We are building the building blocks for this package first
// via the sub-packages.
